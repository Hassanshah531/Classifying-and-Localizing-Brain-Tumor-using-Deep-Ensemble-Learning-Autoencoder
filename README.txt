Brain tumors are one of the deadliest diseases in adults. The 
cancerous cells in the tumor multiply rapidly, severely 
affecting the patient's ability to function normally. Clinical 
practice uses a variety of imaging modalities like CT, MRI and 
PET scans to assess the type, size and location of brain tumors.
The objective of the proposed work is to automate the process 
of classifying and segmenting brain tumors from T1W-CE Magnetic
Resonance Image (MRI). The multi-class classification of brain
tumors (BCT) is considered as one of the most challenging 
problems in medical imaging. The proposed work achieves
 maximum results in terms of sensitivity, specificity and 
diagnostic accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art models 
on T1W-CE MRI dataset
